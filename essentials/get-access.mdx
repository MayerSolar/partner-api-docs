<Warning>
  The Mayer Partner API only provides read-only access to our CRM and cannot be used to update records or write information to Mayer.
</Warning>

To obtain a Mayer Partner API token, have an administrator of your company reach out to our Solutions Architect, Sarmad Wahab.

The email to send your API application to is [sarmad.wahab@mayersolar.com](mailto:sarmad.wahab@mayersolar.com)

In this email, please provide your use case and estimated number of API calls per month, and please include your development team in the email for a direct line of communication.

The Mayer Onboarding team will help get you set up with an API key and set up a call to get you started on your first use case.
