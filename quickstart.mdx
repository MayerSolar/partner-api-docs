Get your first integration with Mayer running in just three steps.

### Step 1: Obtain an API Token

If you don't have an API token already, please visit [Obtain an API Token](/essentials/get-access) to learn how to obtain one.

### Step 2: Write your first API call

<RequestExample>

```c# Program.cs
string mayerApiToken = "88888888888888888888";
var client = new HttpClient();

// Attach the API token to your HTTP client
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidation("Authorization", $"Bearer {mayerApiToken}");

// Fetch your deal via HTTP in JSON
var deal = await client.GetFromJsonAsync<Deal>("https://api.mayerex.com/api/deals/76665798864");

Console.WriteLine(deal.DealName); // Success!
```

</RequestExample>

### Step 3: Go live

Great\! Now you've successfully integrated Mayer with your platform. From this point forward, you can integrate how you'd like and publish your code to your servers and go live as soon as possible\!

Don't worry about accidentally deleting data or overriding input, the API is **read-only.**
